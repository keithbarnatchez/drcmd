Title: Doubly-Robust Causal Inference with Missing Data

Description: Doubly-robust estimation of counterfactual means in the presence of missing
    data. The drcmd() function estimates counterfactual means for binary point treatments
    and reports average treatment effects, as well as causal risk ratios and odds ratios
    for binary outcomes. General missingness patterns in the data are allowed and automatically
    determined by the function -- the only requirement is that any missingness occurs at random
    conditional on variables that are always available. For scenarios where non-missingness 
    probabilities are known, as is common in two-phase sampling designs, users can provide
    the non-missingness probabilities through the Rprobs argument. Users can fit nuisance 
    functions through either highly-adaptive LASSO (HAL) or SuperLearner, the latter of which
    the user must specify libraries.
